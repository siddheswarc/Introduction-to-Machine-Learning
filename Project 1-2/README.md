# LeToR using Linear Regression
The goal of this project is to use Machine Learning to solve a problem that arises in Information Retrieval, known as Learning to Rank (LeToR) problem.

The project involves two tasks:
1. Training a Linear Regression model on LeToR dataset using a closed-form solution
2. Training a Linear Regression model on LeToR dataset using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
