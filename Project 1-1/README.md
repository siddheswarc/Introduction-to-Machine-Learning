# Software 1.0 vs Software 2.0
The goal of this project is to compare two problem solving approaches in Software Development: the logic-based approach (Software 1.0) and the Machine Learning approach (Software 2.0).

## Software 1.0
Software 1.0 is a simple Python program to find if a number is divisible by 3 or 5. If the number is divisible by 3 we print 'Fizz', if it is divisible by 5 we print 'Buzz', if it is divisible by both 3 and 5 we print 'FizzBuzz'.

This simple program gives us a 100% accuracy as we write the algorithm using which the machine finds out which label/class (i.e. 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 'FizzBuzz' or 'Other') a particular number belongs to.

## Software 2.0
Software 2.0 is a Machine Learning problem wherein we have a training and a testing dataset. Given our training dataset, the model finds relationship between different inputs and its outputs and we then check to see how accurate predictions are made by the model on our testing dataset.
